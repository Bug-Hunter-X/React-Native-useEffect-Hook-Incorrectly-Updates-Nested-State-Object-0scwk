This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that modifies the state.  The problem arises when the callback function attempts to update the state using `setMyState(prev => prev + 1)` and the state is an object rather than a primitive type.  The update does not correctly reflect the change in the UI, and the object may even appear to be immutable. This happens because React Native may not correctly detect updates to deeply nested object properties within the state. The object reference might remain the same, leading to a perceived lack of update.
